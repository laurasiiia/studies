# 1. an high-level overview of javascript

high-level is when everything happens automatically, the language is easier to read because the computer already does most of the translation things > its easier to read but is not that fast!
low level is when the developer has to manage resources alone

garbage collected automatically removes old and unused objects and it cleans the code automatically from time to time by itself

> js is interpreted or just-in-time compiled..
> the pc only read by 0 or 1, this is machine code
> ... every programming language needs to be compiled or

paradigm is an approach and mindset of structing our code, which will direct your coding style and technique.

    1. procedural programming
        is what we are doing, organizing in a clear way with some functions in btwn

    2. object oriented programming

    3. function programming

first class function > function tretead as variables. we can pass functions into other functions and return them from functions

js is dynicamically typed, that is, it is faster to type, it understant variables changing automatically

js is single thread so it can only do one thing at a time

non-blocking event loop executes long running tasks in the "background" and puts them back in the main thread once they are finished
