# 2. the javascript engine and runtime

a js engine is a program that executes js code, every browser has its own js engine. chrome has the v8 but also node js (that build service aplications)

every js engine contains a call stack and a heap
callstack is where our code is actually executed using execution contexts

> heap is a unstructed memory pool that stores the objects the aplications need

### how the code is compiled to machine code??

compilation vs interpretation >compilation: the entire code is converterd into the machine code at once, and writtend to a binary file that can be executed by any computer

> the first step: the machine is coded in a portable file and then its executed in the cpu, and this execution can happen way after the compilation

> interpretation: interpreter runs through the source code and executes it line by line

    the code is read and executed line by line, at the same time, but still needs to be converted to machine code but happens right before its executed, not ahead of time

js used to be purely interpreted but they are much slower than compiled languages... with modern js low performance is no longer acceptable so now it uses a mix between the two: >just in time (JIT) compilation: the entire code is converted into machine code at once, than executed immediately

> the machine is compiled NOT IN A PORTABLE FILE, and that executes it IMMEDIATELY. its a lot faster.

in the engine, the steps are:

#### PARSING, the code is parsed into a dated structure called the abstract sintax tree or AST.

it splits every line of the code into pieces that are meaningful to the language like const or function key words and than it saves theses codes into the tree in a structed way. this step also checks if there is any sintax errors and the resulted tree will be use to generate the machine code.

> this tree has nothing to do with DOM
> this tree is just a representation of the entire code inside the engine

#### COMPILATION:

takes the generated AST and compiles it into machine code. this machine code is

#### EXECUTION:

executed right away. happens in a call stack.

modern js engines have a clever optmization strategies: they create a very unoptimized version of machine code in the beggining, so they can start executing it as fast as possible, then, in the background, this code is being >OPTIMIZED and compiled during the already running execution, and its done multiple times... and the unoptimized code is swapped for the new, more optimized code without stopping the execution..
this process is what makes modern engines like v8 so fast
all of this parsing and optmization happens in special threads that we cant access from our code.

### the runtime in the browser:

we can imagine the js runtime like a box or a container that includes all the things that we need to use js in the browser. without an engine there is no runtime and there is no js at all. but in order to the engine to work we need the WEB APIs (DOM, timers, fetch api...). are functionalities provided to the engine, acessible on window object but are NOT part of the js language itself. js gets access to this apis through the global window.
the runtine also includes a callback queue: contains all the callback functions that are ready to be executed, like callback function from DOM event listener like a button.. 'click'. the first thing that happens after the event is the callback function is put into the callback queue, then the callback is passed into the call stack so it can be executed. this is called

#### EVENT LOOP

so it takes the callback functions from the callback queue and puts them in the call stack so that they can be executed

> its essential for non-block concurrency model

### the runtime in node.js:

is pretty similar with browser but without the web apis (since is the browser that provides theses). instead there as multiples C++ bindings and thread pool.
