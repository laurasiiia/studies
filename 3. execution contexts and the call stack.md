# 3. execution contexts and the call stack

> how is js code executed?

lets assume the code has just finished compiling. its ready to be executed. the global executing context (for top-level code > not inside any function) ((functions are only executed when they are called, so everything else is executed first)) is created. what will be executed: const, and the function too, but not its body > the function body will be executed only when called, but the name of the function needs to be read in order to be prepared to be called at some point.

what is an execution context?
is an environment in which a piece of js is executed. stores all the necessary information for some code to be executed, its like a box that stores all the necessary information like local variables or arguments passed into a function. js ALWAYS runs inside an execution context.

lets imagine we order a pizza. the pizza comes in a box and comes with necessary items, like a cutter or a receipt. the pizza is the js code to be executed, the box is the execution context >> the environment to eat pizza. the cutter and the receipt are necessary to eat the pizza, or EXECUTE the code.

in any js project, no matter how large it is, there is only one global execution context, its always there as a default context in where top level content will execute.

once this first code (top level) finished executing, the functions finally start to execute as well. for each and every function called, a new execution context will be created containing all the information that is necessary to run that SINGLE function. and methods (that are simply functions attached to objects). all these executed contexts together make the call stack.

when all the functions are done executing, the engine will wait for callback functions to arrive so it can execute these. for example, a callback function associated to a click event. is the event loop that provides these new callback functions.

1. variable environment
   is where all of this are stored:
   -let, const and var declarations
   -functions
   -argument objects - contains all the arguments that were passed into the function that the current execution context belongs to, since each function has its own execution context.

   however, a function can access variables outside of the function:

2. scope chain
   references to variables that are located outside of the current function

3. this keyword

these are all generation in the "creation phase", right before execution.

> the call stack

its a "place" where execution context gets stacked on top of each other, to keep track of where we are in the execution. as if you and your friends ordered pizza and each friend has its own box, and you stack the boxes in top of each other to keep track to which box belongs to each friend.

the order is like this: first, the global execution, executing variables and etc, then, lets say a variable contains a function ('const x = first()'), the function is called and it creates a execution context to execute that function. if in the middle of this function, another function is called, the execution of that first function is paused, another execution context is created and that second function is executed. the first function has stopped by now and will only continue when the second function returns.
this happens because js has only one thread of execution. it can only do one thing at a time
the second function returns (return c;): it means that the function execution will be popped of the call stack and disappear from the computer. what happens next is that the first function will be the active execution again, returning to where it was in the code.
this is why the call stack is good, because without it all piled up, the engine wouldnt know where to come back in the code, what it was executing before. its like a map, because it insures the order of execution never gets lost.
the first function finishes being executed, and returns. the current executed context (of the first function) is now popped off the call stack. the global context is now the current context again, and the line of function executed is the variable that called the function ('const x = first()'). the value is finally assigned to x.
now, the program will stay in this state for ever until is eventually really finished, when we close the browser tab or window. than, the global execution is also popped off the stack.
