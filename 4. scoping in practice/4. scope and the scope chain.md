# 4. scope and the scope chain

> each execution context have a:

    1. variable environment
    2. scope chain
    3. this keyword

### scope chain

it controls how our programs variables ar organized and accessed by the js engine. "where do variables live?" or "where can we access a certain variable, and where not?"

in js there is lexical scoping: means the way variables are organized is controlled by placement of functions and blocks in the code. a function that is inside another function has access to the variables of the parent function.
is influenced by where exactly you write your functions and code blocks

scope is a space or environment in which a certain variable is declared (variable environment in case of functions > stored in a function execution context). there is global scope, function scope and block scope.
in the case of functions, scope and variable environment is mostly the same thing.

scope of a variable is the entire region of our code where a certain variable can be acessed.
scope is not the the same thing as scope of a variable.

> remember: scope is a place where a variable is declared. the same thing for functions, since functions are just values stored in a variable

#### the 3 types of scope:

1. global scope
   -top level code
   variables declared outside any of function or block, acessed everywhere in our program, in all functions and all blocks.

2. function scope
   -each and every function creates a scope
   -variables declared inside that function scope are acessible only inside a function, NOT ouside
   local variables live in the function, outside of the functions, the variables are not accessible at all
   tecnically the same as variables environment but it still needs the name scope because blocks also create scopes
   -also called local scope

3. block scope (es6)
   -blocks are everything that is inside curly braces
   -variables declared inside the block are acessible only inside the block
   HOWEVER this only applies to let and const variables (NOT VAR, var would be acessible outside the block and be scoped into the function scope or the global scope)
   let and const are block scoped / var is function scoped
   -functions are also block scoped - only in strict mode
   this means that function declared inside the block, is only acessible INSIDE the block

### the scope chain

every scope always have access to all the variables from outer scopes. lets say that there is the global scope, a first function scope and inside the first function there is the second scope can be accessed by the second scope, because the second scope is ALSO inside the first function (the parent).
if there is a third function, declared later, after the first function has returned already, the third function cant have access to the variables inside the first function, because they are separated.
its like a tree with branches:
global scope > first() scope > second() scope
if a scope needs to use a certain variable but cannot find it in the current scope, it will look up in the scope chain to see if can find the variable into one of the parents scopes. if it cant, there will be a ReferenceError.
these variables are not coppied into one scoped into another, they simply look up to find it.
it DOENST happen the same way around. they cannot look "down" into their "child scopes". the first scope will never have acess into a variable stored in a child scope. the global scope cannot look into the second function scope.

the block created by if {} also creates an scope. however, this scopes only work for es6 variable types > for let and const. if inside the block is a var = x, it wont be scoped, it belongs into the parent scope, a function scope or the global one.

example:

    function first() {
    if (age >= 30) {
    var millenial = true;
    }
    };

the var variable is not inside de block scope (the {} inside the if), is scoped into the first() scope. var is not block scoped. let and const are block scoped.

if the second() scope is inside the first() scope, right below the if function, this means: 1. the first() scope is the parent scope of the second() scope 2. the var variable belongs to the first() scope, even if its "stored" inside the if function 3. the second() scope has access to the var variable because it belongs from its parent

the block scope also have access to its parent scopes variable just like other scopes. global scopes can be read everywhere, because they are always at the top of the scope chain. the variables inside of it are called global variables. >>"siblings" scopes dont get access to each other. the if block cant access variables in the second scope nor the other way around. the scope chain only work UPWARDS, not sideways or downwards.

### scope chain vs call stack

> CALL STACK is the orden in which functions were called
> SCOPE CHAIN is the order in which fuctions are written in the code (has nothing to do with the order in which functions were called). it does get the VE from the execution contexts but the order are not relevant.

the call stack pilles up all the execution contexts for each function called and fills them with all the variables of that function (in the variable environment > VE).

> CHECK .JPG CALL STACK VS SCOPE CHAIN

the big difference between call stack execution contexts and the scopes, is that in the EC, what it contains is simply what it is inside the function in the code.. so if:

    third() {
        d = hey
    };

the EC context will contains only "d = hey". but, since third() is stored inside the second() and second() is also stored inside first(), the third() SCOPE will contain not only the "d = hey" but also every single variable stored in the parents scope = the second() and the third(). considering:

    first() {second() {third()}}; (WHICH IS NOT THE CASE IN THE .JPG)

.jpg > how does the second() can call the third() if its not stored inside of it? the third() is stored inside the global scope, therefore the second() can acess it freely! but, the third() CANT acess variables stored in the second(), because second() is stored inside the first(), which third() also cant acess. its different branches from the global scope. it only go up, not sideways. (even though it was the second() who called the third(), still the third() get no access from it)
PROOF THAT THE ORDER THE CODE IS WRITTEN DOES NOT AFFECT THE SCOPE CHAIN AT ALL.
